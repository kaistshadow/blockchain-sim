# Project Overview
Blockchain-sim is a project to build a efficient and realistic simulation/emulation framework for blockchain applications.
It also aims to provide common development/testing framework for ordinary blockchain applications.
Blockchain-sim is also known as BLEEP (BLockchain Emulation and Evaluation Platform).

The core aims of the Blockchain-sim are as follows.

* Simulating the real blockchain application with real application binary (e.g., bitcoind)

* Suggestion of well-organized blockchain component libraries that can be leveraged for developing various blockchain applications

* Synthesizing the various patterns of transactions or blocks with easy-to-setup interface (Blockchain benchmarks)

* Simulating the propagation of transactions or blocks on simulated P2P network and visualization

* High performance testing that enables the simulation of more-than-thousand nodes on a (single) commodity machine

Blockchain-sim is now under development on top of the open-source discrete-event network simulator, called Shadow, that have been mainly utilized for simulating Tor.

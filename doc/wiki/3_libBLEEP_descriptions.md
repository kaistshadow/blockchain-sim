We have implemented modular libBLEEP architecture with a support for handling asynchronous events (such as network I/O).

Leveraging the library architecture, we implemented several blockchain APIs and modules
which lead to easier mix-and-match development of blockchain.

Current implemented blockchain modules are as follows.

* Blockchain data structure (Tree, DAG[TODO])
* Consensus (PoW, PoS[TODO], PBFT[TODO])
* Network (Peer Discovery, Gossip/flooding algorithm)[TODO]

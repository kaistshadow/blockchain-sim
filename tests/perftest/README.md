# Performance Test Section
To build scalable large scale Blockchain network simulation, It is required to run thousands of virtual nodes on Shadow network simulator on the reasonable speed.
To improve computation speed and resource usage, proper analysis should be preceded.
We divided the resource target into three group, cpu(computation resource), memory, and storage.

The testing tools includes:
* computation resource analysis
** perf tools
** flame graph
** heatmap analysis
* memory resource analysis
* storage resource analysis
